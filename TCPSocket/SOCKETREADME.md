The createSocket.py tool works like any other Linux command.
It can create a TCP connection as a client or listen to a TCP connection as a server.
Typing "-h" after the command will give a list of all the configurations.

This tool sends a message to a recipient.
The server (-s flag) opens the connection and the client (-c flag) reciprocates.

Each side can only send one message. The connection closes after the message is received.
