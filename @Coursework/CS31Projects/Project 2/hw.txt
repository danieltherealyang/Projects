1. What is the output produced by the following program segment? Don't just run it â€” trace through it and figure it out by hand (which is a skill you'll need for the exams).
string grendel = "endl";
cout << "endl"; //endl
cout << grendel; //endlendl
cout << endl; //endlendl/n
cout << "grendel"; //endlendl/n grendel

Output:
endlendl
grendel

2. The program prints a triangle made out of "#" characters with the number of "#" characters equal to the line number it prints on until the line number that is input by the user is reached. 

3. 
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
    int side;

    cout << "Enter a number: ";
    cin >> side;

    for (int i = 0; i < side; i++)
    {
	int j = i;
	while (j >= 0) {
	    cout << "#";
	    j--;
	}
	cout << "\n";
    }
}

4. 
switch(codeSection) {
    case 281:
	cout << "bigamy";
	break;
    case 321:
    case 322:
	cout << "selling illegal lottery tickets";
	break;
    case 383:
	cout << "selling rancid butter";
	break;
    case 598:
	cout << "injuring a bird in a public cemetery";
	break;
    default:
	cout << "some other crime";	
}
